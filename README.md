# Gemini-AI-Chatbot

ðŸš€ Building a Chatbot with Streamlit and Google Gemini ðŸ¤– Excited to share my latest project where I built a chatbot interface using Streamlit and integrated Google Gemini (a generative AI model). This project is all about creating an interactive and intelligent assistant that can respond to user queries in real-time. ðŸŽ¯ Key Features: User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, ensuring smooth and intuitive user interaction. Real-Time Responses: Integrated Google Gemini AI to generate responses based on user input. Session State: Kept track of chat history using Streamlit's session state, ensuring that the conversation flows naturally. Challenges & Solutions: Initially struggled with placing the user input box at the bottom of the screen, but I successfully managed it by controlling the display order of chat history and input box.
